### ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a final year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Iâ€™m passionate about building scalable software solutions and enjoy turning complex problems into clean, efficient systems. With a strong foundation in web development, microservices, and artificial intelligence, I focus on delivering quality through smart work rather than hard work.

I'm also deeply passionate about **mathematics** and **competitive coding**. I won **1st place at MoraXtreme 2024** and secured **4th place at ENIGMA**, demonstrating my problem-solving abilities in high-pressure coding contests. Iâ€™ve also actively participated in various **hackathons**, where I collaborate, innovate, and build solutions under tight deadlines.

As a freelancer, Iâ€™ve worked on various full-stack projects, and I love diving into both frontend design and backend logic. I maintain a GPA of 3.83/4.00.
If youâ€™re into tech, code, or cool ideas, feel free to connect with me!
